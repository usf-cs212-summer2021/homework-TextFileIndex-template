TextFileIndex
=================================================

![Points](../../blob/badges/points.svg)

For this homework, you will create a class that implements the `SimpleIndex` interface and provide a missing `default` implementation in the `SimpleIndex` interface. See the Javadoc comments in the template code for additional details.

## Hints ##

Below are some hints that may help with this homework assignment:

  - The code will not compile until you implement the `SimpleIndex` interface in the `TextFileIndex` class.

  - When creating a default implementation, you can call other methods in the interface even if they are not implemented.

  - Most of the implementations require 1 to 3 lines of code.

  - This homework helps you think about design for the project, but **should not be used directly** in your project (which is an *inverted* index, and this homework is a *forward* index).

These hints are *optional*. There may be multiple approaches to solving this homework.
